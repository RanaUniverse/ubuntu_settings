## What & How does this code work? 🤔

This project help me to setup Ubuntu os machine easily with the ```sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager``` and then ```sudo apt install gnome-shell-extensions```.

I mainly want one taskbar/panel in my desktop interface, so that i can easily navigate my mouse and use keyboard shortcut to access apps easily. It works like download the online extensions and then using the doncf file it will help to get back all the settings i changes in the extensions, settings, shortcuts and so on. Everything is there in the ```./installation_script.sh``` file which will do the work automtically. It little looks like the Windows 10 interface with full customization potential.
