# My Project Idea


## v1.0.0

Here was basic extensions only.


## v1.1.0

I have plan to add 2 extra extensions:

- [Eye On Cursor - Version: 10](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7036/eye-on-cursor/) – Highlights the cursor for better visibility.  
- [Hide Items - Version: 7](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6771/hide-items/) – Allows you to hide desktop items for a cleaner look.  



## v1.2.0

I have made a plan to solve the issue of the [username related problem](https://github.com/RanaUniverse/ubuntu_settings/issues/1) which cause me the problems of i cannot see the images and others files path which was used the `rana-universe` as username in the dconf bkup file.

So i will solve this issue in this version.
1. I first though to use `$HOME` and solve this issue but the file path in the bkup txt file not support this, so i need to though another plan.

2. So i though to make a script which will edit the locaion of `rana-universe` to current system's username, so i think to do this which will solve my issue.

3. From Now there will not any username related problem from this releases.
