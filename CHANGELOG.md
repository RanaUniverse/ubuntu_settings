# My Project Idea


## v1.0.0

Here was basic extensions only.


## v1.1.0

I have plan to add 2 extra extensions:

- [Eye On Cursor - Version: 10](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7036/eye-on-cursor/) – Highlights the cursor for better visibility.  
- [Hide Items - Version: 7](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6771/hide-items/) – Allows you to hide desktop items for a cleaner look.
